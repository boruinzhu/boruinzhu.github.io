Welcome on my webpage!

I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Harvard University. My interest lie broadly in macroeconomics.

Before joining my wonderful [cohort](https://economics.harvard.edu/first-year-graduate-students) here in Cambridge (Massachusetts), I had the honour to work as a pre-doctoral research assistant for Professors [Benjamin Moll](https://benjaminmoll.com/) and [Ricardo Reis](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/reisr/) at the Centre for Macroeconomics, London School of Economics (LSE).

I obtained my BSc in Economics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Mannheim in 2020. During these undergraduate studies I spent an academic exchange year at the National University of Singapore. After that, I graduated with an MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (EME) from the LSE in 2021.
